    <p style="color:blue;">Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects.</p>
    <p>Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) <br>
        and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) <br>
        that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.</p>
