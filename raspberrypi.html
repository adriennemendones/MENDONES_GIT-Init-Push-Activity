        <p style="color:blue;">The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, <br>but 
            it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins,
            allowing you to control electronic components<br> for physical computing
            and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
            <p>Raspberry Pi is the name of a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, <br>
                a UK charity that aims to educate people in computing and create easier access to computing education.</p>
